                                           Bootstrap(FrameWork)


Q-1: What is Bootstrap, and why is it useful for website design?
Ans: Designed to enable responsive development of mobile-first websites, Bootstrap provides a collection of syntax for template designs.

As a framework, Bootstrap includes the basics for responsive web development, so developers only need to insert the code into a pre-defined grid system. The Bootstrap framework is built on Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), cascading style sheets (CSS) and JavaScript. Web developers using Bootstrap can build websites much faster without spending time worrying about basic commands and functions.


Q-2:Explain the Bootstrap grid system and how it helps create responsive layouts?
Ans:The Bootstrap grid system is a flexible layout system that uses a series of rows and columns to arrange content on a web page.
It is based on a 12-column layout that adapts to different screen sizes using predefined classes.
This grid system ensures that your design is responsive, meaning it automatically adjusts for various devices, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.
 responsive layout :

Device Adaptability :  By using breakpoint-specific classes (.col-sm-6, .col-md-4, etc.), you can define different layouts for various screen sizes.
Customizable Widths : Each column can take up a specific fraction of the row, like half (col-6) or one-third (col-4), ensuring precise control over the layout.
Consistent Structure : Provides a standard structure, making layouts easier to plan and maintain.
Alignment and Spacing : Includes utilities like .align-items-centre and .justify-content-between for positioning and spacing.
